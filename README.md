# Fictional-store-Dashboard
🛒 Fake Store Dashboard created using Power BI and enriched with data generated in Python using the amazing  library!

✨** What I Did**
I started by leveraging the  library to generate realistic and fictional data for a complete sales system project. This includes creating six interconnected CSV tables:
- **Customers** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑  
- **Products** 📦  
- **Sales** 💸  
- **Payment Methods** 💳  
- **Inventory** 📊  
- **Suppliers** 🚚  
Additionally, I created another table for branches, detailing their regions, countries, and cities.
This model establishes the relationships between the various tables in the dataset, defining how they interact and share data.

And this is the final result of my dashboard
