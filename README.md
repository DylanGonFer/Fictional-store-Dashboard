# Fictional-store-Dashboard
Fake store Dashboard made with Power BI, and data with Python (Faker Library)
I started using the  library to generate realistic and fictional data for a sales system project. The project includes six interconnected CSV tables: customers, products, sales, payment methods, inventory, and suppliers. Additionally, I created another table for branches, detailing their regions, countries, and cities.
