✨**What I Did** 

I started by leveraging the  library to generate realistic and fictional data for a complete sales system project. This includes creating six interconnected CSV tables:
- **Customers** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑  
- **Products** 📦  
- **Sales** 💸  
- **Payment Methods** 💳  
- **Inventory** 📊  
- **Suppliers** 🚚

Additionally, I included another table for branches 🏢, detailing their regions, countries, and cities. This forms the backbone for a realistic and structured dataset for analysis.

🌐 Model Overview
This relational model connects all the tables seamlessly, defining how data interacts across the system. With carefully crafted keys, I’ve ensured logical and dynamic relationships to power insightful analyses.
